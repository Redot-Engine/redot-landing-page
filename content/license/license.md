## The Engine

### Redot Engine License Agreement
Redot Engine is a [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software) released under the permissive [MIT license](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) (also known as the Expat license).

This license grants users the following freedoms:

- You are free to use Redot Engine, for any purpose.
- You can study how Redot Engine works and change it.
- You can distribute unmodified and changed versions of Redot Engine, even commercially and under a different license (including proprietary).

### Attribution Notice

Redot Engine is derived from Godot Engine, which is free and open source software also licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

As required by the MIT license, whenever you distribute Redot Engine or derivative works based on it, you must include both the Redot Engine and 
Godot Engine copyright notices and license statements.

## Your game

Redot Engine's license terms and copyright do not apply to the content you create with it; you are free to license your games how you see best fit,
and will be their sole copyright owner(s).

Note however that the Redot Engine binary that you would distribute with your game is a copy of the "Software" as defined in the license, and you are therefore required to include 
the copyright notice and license statement somewhere in your documentation.

The Redot Engine developers consider that a link to this page ([redotengine.org/license](/license)) in your game documentation or credits would be an acceptable way to satisfy the license terms.

See [Complying with Licenses](https://docs-latest.redotengine.org/about/complying_with_licenses) in the documentation for more information.
