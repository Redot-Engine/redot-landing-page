Hello and thank you for coming to our site. There has been not just a lot of media about our project,
but a lot of hype. As one of the founders of this website I wanted to give a few words about the goals
I wish to achieve with this project.

When I first got into discussions with the other founders it was more of a small, but close-knit
community project that we wanted to grow organically.

We were sick of all our favorite games, engines, and more being using as a platform for ideologues
to spout their opinions and drive a wedge between gamers.

Due to timing, luck, and some intentional promotion we quickly exploded in growth leading to us
making this a far bigger project than we ever dreamed of.

I want to make Redot not just a great apolitical no-nonsense engine of the future. I want to see
Redot become the standard for community engagement, community management, and open-source projects.

I want us to blow open the doors on the industry and start taking back this hobby so many of us
find comfort in.

For the love of gaming,

Nicholai

A Founder of Redot Engine/community.
