The Roadmap Is Here!

One of the most frequently asked questions we have received in the last month has been, “where’s the roadmap?”

It's something we've thought about and have been working on since announcing this project. We do realize it was frustrating
to hear "we're working on it", but we wanted to make sure that the plans were universally agreed on before presenting it to everyone.

Most people don’t realize the amount of work it takes to put a more formal fork together. Sure, Anyone can fork an open
source project, but if you want to do anything outside of a local build, you need to build a lot of infrastructure, and
rebranding is just the tip of the iceberg.

Website, hosting, build system, meetings, feedback, many many hours working by many devs to get all this up and running,
along with all the hard work by moderators, artists, web developers, a huge community of people devoting their time and efforts 
to make this project a reality. I can’t thank everyone enough for the many hands that have toiled long hours over this. 
You all have made this dream a reality.

It’s obviously nowhere near over. We still have a ton to do, and on the eve of beta 2 launch we give you our roadmap.

We cannot thank you guys enough for your support, patience, and passion for Redot. Hopefully you now have a clearer 
picture of where this project is going, and we cannot wait to see the games you all make!
