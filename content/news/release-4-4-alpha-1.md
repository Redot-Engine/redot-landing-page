# Redot 4.4 Alpha 1 Release!

We’re thrilled to announce the release of the alpha
[version 4.4 of our game engine, Redot](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine/releases/tag/2024101114)!

This version features a rebranding and introduces a new Preview Environment with an updated default color
scheme and a new horizon color option (see screenshot below for an example).

Important Note: Currently, we do not have a Mac build available as we are still in the process of obtaining
a Mac developer account certificate. We appreciate your understanding as we work towards this.

While our website is still in the works, you can access the alpha build through the releases on GitHub
directly.

Thank you for your patience and support! We look forward to sharing more updates about the engine and other
[community announcements](https://discord.gg/redot) soon.

Please note we are working on streamlining the download process as you read this.

Redot Team
