# Notice

We are pleased to announce that Friday 10/18/2024 will be when our community votes on all the submissions for the Redot mascot contest.

That means two things.

-You have this week to work on any designs you wish to submit. (Check the discord announcements to see where submissions should be made)

-You must be in the discord to vote on the submissions.

Note: We have a specific place where submissions need to be made on the discord. Any that are made on other platforms will not be considered largely due to logistics and keeping track. Leading up to Friday we will be contacting those who made submissions so we can give credit as desired.
