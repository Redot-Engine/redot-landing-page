We’re thrilled to announce a milestone moment for Redot: **stability has been achieved!** 

After a month and a half of relentless effort by a lot of people, we’ve reached a point where we can confidently put forward a polished, reliable game development tool, one you can truly depend on. **Redot 4.3 Stable is now live.** 

## REDOT 4.3 STABLE

Here are some notable additions and fixes over Godot 4.3:

- Customizable Horizon Color

- A new input stage has been added to the physics system to handle events that were unused during the physics picking stage.
- AStarGrid2D now allows for searching smaller sections of the world.
- The Color Picker can now use overbright values allowing for brighter and more vibrant colors.
- The performance of the String Type's replacement operations has been improved.
- Web sockets have been improved by ensuring that data isn't lost between the client and server.
- Pixel Snapping has been set to use "canvas space" over "world space" to ensure pixels are aligned to the viewport.
- Converting from "world space" to "view space" has been corrected to work as intended for orthogonal projections.


Keep in mind this is not a comprehensive list of the impactful changes, its just a highlight of what users may be most interested in. Please note that these were chosen to optimize the stability of the engine and maintain compatibility for those switching from Godot, so the list of new features are small compared to Godot 4.3.

Finally, we'd like to thank the core devs on the project(in alphabetical order): ChocolateChipAussie, decryptedchaos, McDubh, skogi, Spartan322 and trashguy for their tireless work in getting us to this point. Also, a special thanks to all the many contributors who helped along the way. We appreciate everything.

## The Future


This has been a crazy experience for all of us — and, personally, a transformative one. I've learned more about working with people, running social media, coordinating teams and overall project management — not to mention actual engine work — than I have through all my years of professional experience. Every single day continues to bring new 
lessons.

This achievement belongs to everyone who has been part of the Redot story. While a small group of us planted the seed of forking Godot, the project’s success has been powered by countless contributors who turned that vision into reality. Doing anything on this scale is a huge undertaking, and there’s a lot of moving pieces involved. From those who joined us in the early stages, to Heroes In A Pinch, the unsung champions who stepped in during critical moments, to the current team tirelessly maintaining the project and keeping operations running smoothly — your contributions have been invaluable. Redot wouldn’t be what it is without you (and, in fact, it wouldn't be at all). Thank you for making all of this work.

 At its core, Redot was never about reinventing the wheel — it was not meant to be a huge departure from Godot. By maintaining close parity with Godot, we can provide something extra — the community, the quality-of-life improvements, new features, additional bug fixes — without barring people from benefiting from things coming down from Godot and its developers. We want you to benefit from Godot's core updates and features: each of the features introduced in Godot's 4.3 version is fully available in Redot 4.3 (you can check the feature list here: https://godotengine.org/releases/4.3/), as will be the case with features of the upcoming 4.4 version. That being said, we also try to include meaningful changes. Which brings us to…

## Redot Experimental 

Over the last few weeks we’ve been building up a very special project called Redot Experimental. This initiative serves as a testing ground for bigger changes and bolder ideas — features that might break compatibility with Godot, or ones that simply wouldn’t fit within the constraints of the original Redot project. Rest assured, Redot Experimental will not detract from our primary development efforts. Instead, we've set it up in a way that allows us to poke, prod, and experiment, paving the way for future innovations that could one day enhance Redot or serve as standalone solutions. The idea is to develop tools and features that will assist our community members in doing what matters the most: developing their games without a hassle.

One of the first major projects under Redot Experimental is the Redot Launcher, a tool simplifying engine and project management, providing a centralized hub through which developers can easily switch engine versions, manage projects, and jumpstart new game ideas with ready-made templates. Here’s a work-in-progress screenshot showing the current version of the Launcher in action:

## The Redot Academy 
Game development should be accessible to everyone.

This simple statement became the idea behind the Redot Academy, one of the ways in which we wanted to support our community. Originally started by one of our community members, the Academy offered free live classes in Redot game development. 
Unfortunately, due to scheduling problems, this part has been put on hold.

However, the idea of our Academy lives on. 

We’re currently in the process of transforming the project into something more robust and even more useful, building a dedicated Academy website to host tutorials, tools, and structured learning paths tailored to what Redot can offer, and what our community wants. Whether you’re just starting out or refining advanced skills, Redot Academy will be your go-to resource for free, top-tier game development education. 

There are already Godot tutorials which do work with Redot. However, we think we have some unique things we can offer our users, and we’ll announce those as we get a little closer to launching them. Watch for upcoming announcements as we prepare to launch this initiative, and let us know if you'd like to get involved.
       
## Expanding the Community 
Our mission goes beyond creating and maintaining a game engine — we’re also focused on building a thriving community. To that end, we’re excited to introduce two new platforms for our users to interact with: 

• **Forums** — Not everyone uses Discord, and we want to ensure every developer has a space to connect, share ideas, get support or keep in touch in general. Our forums will provide a structured platform for collaboration and communication. As soon as it’s ready, we’ll post an announcement and start letting people sign up.

• **Contributors Page** — Behind every great project is a network of incredible people. Our Contributors Page will recognize everyone who has helped us out in some way, whether with the website, the engine, or any of the other areas that needed hands. Whatever you're doing to help make Redot the best it can be — your contributions will never be forgotten.

That's it for this update. As we celebrate this major milestone, we’re also focused on the road ahead. There's a lot of fun stuff in the works and I can't wait to show you more as we move forward. From the Engine Team to the Web Team, Creative Team, Mod Team, Art Team, and all of our amazing Heroes in a Pinch — you're all amazing people. You all have made this project what it is, and it could have been done without you. Thank you. Here’s to building a better future for indie game development, one little step at a time.
