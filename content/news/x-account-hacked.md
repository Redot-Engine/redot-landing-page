Greetings Redot community, Nicholai here, one of the founders of Redot Engine.

As some of you have seen from various announcements on social media and our 
discord our X account was hacked and is being used to message other prominent 
users who are tangently related to us.

We are waiting for X support to restore our proper access and assist 
us in securing the account further in the future.

We understand that this will be a minor roadbump in the long term. In the 
short term it disrupts our momentum we've built with the release of 4.3 
beta.1 and our planned release for 4.3 beta.2

With the bad news out of the way I would like to highlight some positive 
news.

First, 4.3 beta.1 has been widely praised and people are very excited to 
be working on our engine.

Second, developer(s) in the community have come together and with our 
backing have worked on a new Visual scripting add-on called Event Sheets. 
More news will be coming out down the line.

Third, we just started accepting donations to our Ko-fi. If you wish to 
contribute in that way you can find us here:

<h1 style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://ko-fi.com/redotengine">Donate to our Ko-fi</a></h1>

As always we appreciate everyone's massive support and love. It is because 
of all of your passion that we are able to continue working hard on making 
this the best possible version of the engine as we can manage.

Thank you for the wonderful community.

MAK GAM!
