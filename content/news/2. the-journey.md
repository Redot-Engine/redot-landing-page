# What began simply as an idea.


The support we received for the project was astounding.\
\
\
Artists are donating artwork. Volunteers are offering to help with Discord. Developers are contributing their time to the project. Web developers are collaborating to create a website. And so much more.\
\
Witnessing the incredible amount of hard work and dedication that everyone put into this was truly astonishing.\
\
\
Were there bumps along the way? Sure, there were.
Have I learned from them? Absolutely.\
\
I’ve come to realize that there are so many individuals I’ve had the chance to meet. I’m truly grateful that so many have decided to embark on this journey alongside me.\
\
My aim is to offer a space for this international community to unite and engage in discussions about development and many other wonderful topics.\
\
I am excited to embark on this journey with all of you.
