### Image compression

There are 2 ways to compress image images

- Double click on `image-compression.bat` or `image-compression.sh` to run image compression app. You can drag and drop files to convert images.
  You can also run image compression app with: `npm run image`
- Commiting will compress image and delete origin source on pre-commit with husky. But this won't be converted until you commit. And it creates extra commit.

## Publishing Articles

1. There are 2 ways to add an image and the added image will turn into a `.avif` file (used for SEO). Optimal dimensions are 1280x720.

- Double click on image-compression.bat or image-compression.sh to run image compression app. You can drag and drop files to convert images. You can also run image compression app with: `npm run image`
- Add an image inside the `public/img/news` folder. Commiting will compress image and delete origin source on pre-commit with husky. But this won't be converted until you commit. And it creates extra commit.

2. Create a new markdown file inside `content/news` folder. The file name must follow the guidelines for optimal SEO results:
   - File name must be kebab case.
   - File name must all be lowercase
3. Paste the article template (see below) inside the file
4. Write your content
5. Create a pull request and get it merged

### Adding author images

Follow steps 1 in the instructions above but place your avatar inside the `public_images/authors` folder.

### Mirrorlist Automation

Currently we are automatically generate mirrorlist from website. Because the godot engine is poorly designed and changing things related to the version cause a problem from the engine. So we have to keep the json file name with many `.` like this: `4.3.rc.2.mono.json`.
