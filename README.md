## Running locally

### Prerequisites

Make sure [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed.

### To build and run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Public images and image compression

Place public images in `public_images` folder.

For compressing image,

```
npm run compress-image
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Most of time you wouldn't need to run this. This is going to remove old images and create new compressed images.

## Publishing Articles

1. Add an image inside the `public_images/news` folder. Optimal dimensions are 1280x720.
2. Run `npm run compress-image`. This will compress your png image into a `.avif` file (used for SEO).
3. Create a new markdown file inside `content/news` folder. The file name must follow the guidelines for optimal SEO results:
   - File name must be kebab case.
   - File name must all be lowercase
4. Paste the article template (see below) inside the file
5. Write your content
6. Create a pull request and get it merged

```shell
---
title: "Article Title"
date: 2024-10-24T00:00:00Z // publish data
index: 1
description: 50 max word description
image: /img/news/your-compressed-image.avif
alt: Alt of image
ogImage: /img/news/your-compressed-image.avif
tags: ["Releases", "Community"] // Releases or Community
type: "post"
author: "Redot" // Or your username (extra steps apply)
authorImage: /img/authors/redot.avif // link to profile
published: true
---

Your content here...
```

### Adding author images

Follow steps 1 - 2 in the instructions above but place your avatar inside the `public_images/authors` folder.

### Mirrorlist Automation

Currently we are automatically generate mirrorlist from website. Because the godot engine is poorly designed and changing things related to the version cause a problem from the engine. So we have to keep the json file name with many `.` like this: `4.3.rc.2.mono.json`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Vue 3**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript & TypeScript**: Core scripting languages for dynamic functionality.
- **SCSS & CSS**: Styling for creating a responsive and modern design.
