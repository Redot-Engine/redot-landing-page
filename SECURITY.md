# Security Policy

We take security seriously, and we encourage anyone who finds vulnerabilities in the Redot Game Engine Website project to report them responsibly.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not create an issue on the GitHub issue tracker as it will be visible publicly.

1. **contact us privately at [Discord](https://discord.gg/redot)** with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Include the steps required to reproduce the issue, the affected components, and any relevant details.
2. **Do not disclose** the vulnerability publicly until we have had the chance to investigate and release a fix.
3. After a resolution, we may publicly announce the issue and thank you for your responsible disclosure.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and ask that security researchers follow this guideline to allow us time to investigate, fix, and patch the reported issues before any public disclosure.

Thank you for helping to keep the Redot Game Engine Website secure!
